#Hasher
Passwords play a critical role in online authentication.Unfortunately, passwords suffer from
two seemingly in tractable problems: password cracking and passwordtheft. In this project
we have propse "Hash it" a GUI application which is used to generate and hash the
passwords, where user can choose among twelve different hash functions such as sha256,
md5, sha384, sha512 etc. Password hashing is a technique that allows users to remember
simple low-entropy passwords and have them hashed to create high-entropy secure
passwords.
Hash it provides different hash functions where passwords are hashed according to the
selected functions
